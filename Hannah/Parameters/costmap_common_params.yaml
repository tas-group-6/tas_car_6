# We raised the values of obstacle_range and raytrace_range range. As a consequence
# the costmap is updated (marking and clearing) for longer distances. This improves
# the collision avoidance of the car. 

obstacle_range: 3.0 #1.05
raytrace_range: 4.5 #2.5


# We furthermore changed the footprint. We included the fact that the car is not a 
# rectangle and that the wheels can veer. Since the performance of the car worsend 
# with the new parameter, even though it is closer to the real footprint of the car,
# we used the old values again. 

footprint: [[0.33, 0.22], [0.33, -0.22], [-0.33, -0.22], [-0.33, 0.22]]
#footprint: [[0.31, 0.25], [0.33, 0], [0.31, -0.25], [-0.31, -0.22], [-0.33, 0], [-0.31, 0.22]]


# Moreover we tried different values of the inflation_radius, but only got worse performance 
# as a response. So we sticked to the 1.5.

inflation_radius: 1.5
